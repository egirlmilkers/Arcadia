Using Vertex AI requires a Google Cloud project and a Service Account with the correct permissions.

1.  **Set up your Google Cloud Project:**
    * Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project (or select an existing one).
    * Make sure billing is enabled for the project.
    * Go to the "APIs & Services" dashboard and click **"+ Enable APIs and services"**. Search for and enable the **"Vertex AI API"**.

2.  **Create a Service Account:**
    * In the Cloud Console, navigate to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**.
    * Click **"+ Create service account"**.
    * Give it a Service account name (e.g., `arcadia-vertex-user`).
    * Click **"Create and continue"**.
    * In the "Permissions" step, assign the role **`Vertex AI User`**.
    * Click **"Continue"**, then **"Done"** (ignore the "Principals with access" step).

3.  **Generate a JSON Key:**
    * Find your newly created service account in the list.
    * Click the three-dot menu under "Actions" and select **"Manage keys"**.
    * Click **"Add key" > "Create new key"**.
    * Select **JSON** as the key type and click **"Create"**. A `.json` file will be downloaded to your computer

4.  **Add the key to Arcadia:**
    * Open the downloaded `.json` file with a text editor and copy its **entire content**.
    * In Arcadia, go to **Settings > Manage API Keys** and click **"Add New"**.
    * Give it the name `Vertex` (currently no other name will work).
    * **Paste the entire JSON content** into the key field and save. You can now use models that use the Vertex AI API source (the `src` for the model must be `vertex`).

> [!CAUTION]
> KEEP THE JSON SAFE AND SECURE. DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE. ARCADIA WILL ONLY USE THIS LOCALLY.<br>
> YOU ARE FREE TO DELETE IT AFTER PASTING IT INTO ARCADIA BUT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN IT AGAIN.
